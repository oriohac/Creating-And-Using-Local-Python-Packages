# Creating-And-Using-Local-Python-Packages
I created a Rock, paper and Scissors ✂ game where the user selects either  "R", "P" or "S"
The rule of the game is, If the two players choose the same “character” it’s a tie, and the game repeats
Rock beats Scissors
Paper beats Rock
Scissors beats Paper
If user input is invalid (not amongst our options), print an error, and ask for their input again.
If there is a winner, the winner is printed, and the program ends.
